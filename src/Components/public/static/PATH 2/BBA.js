          Ans: A student needs to consider various factors before deciding upon going for 3 year BBA or 5 year BBA MBA. The factors based on which one can choose include plans, budget, institute, etc. If an aspirant is determined to pursue an MBA after completing BBA, then it is a logical decision to opt for an integrated programme. On the other hand, the fee for the integrated programmes is much higher than that of the regular BBA programmes since it is a culmination of two programmes. Some students may decide to gather a few years of work experience before jumping on the MBA bandwagon. Moreover, during pursuing BBA, some students may realise that s/he wants to pursue a different course altogether and do not want to continue in the field of Business Administration.
