        upwards); PUMBA-Pune University offers MBA at Rs.1.50 lakhs; Bangalore
        University MBA fee is Rs.54000. But since private universities have to

        top B-schools, MBA programmes are much older. For example, FMS - Delhi
        University is 60 years old; JBIMS Mumbai is also more than 50 years old.
        These MBA colleges have created a huge alumni base as compared to newer
        PGDM colleges. This helps in high placements also.

        Ans: Simply speaking, MBA (Master of Business Administration) refers to
        a management degree issued by a University affiliated by UGC and PGDM
        (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) refers to post graduate diploma
        offered by a private college or university, affiliated by AICTE. Apart
        from this, there is no major difference between MBA and PGDM.

        MBA or PGDM. It is determined on the basis of factors such as the
        Quality of the Course Curriculum, Pedagogy and the Institute’s Ranking

        Ans: PGDM is Diploma course whereas MBA is a degree course, hence it
        cannot be claimed that PGDM and MBA are completely equivalent. However,
        in terms of core subjects and curriculum, MBA and PGDM are largely
        similar. It is to be noted that if a PGDM college is a member of
        Association of Indian Universities (AIU) then the PGDM is equivalent to
        MBA.

        (PGP) or Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGPM). Until 2017, the
        IIMs offered PGDM and PGP, but the IIM Bill passed that year allows them
        to offer MBA degree as well.

        international exposure, to name a few.

        Ans: After completing an MBA, students can pursue PhD in Management.
        Students who want to pursue academics can opt for Fellow Programme in
        Management. Since PhD is a doctorate degree which can be opted after
        completing a master’s degree, PGDM students will not be eligible for
        PhD. However, FPM is equivalent to PhD.

        Ans: No, it is not necessary to have an MBA degree to get a managerial
        job in a Government organisation. A PGDM in a relevant specialisation is
        equally eligible or suitable for a managerial role in a Government
        organisations. However, having an MBA or a PGDM degree is not enough for
        getting a job in any organisation. The candidate has to fulfil other
        eligibility criteria or other skills required for the role.

        those MBA programmes which are offered by Government or public
        universities. The fee range of MBA programmes in government colleges and
        universities is under Rs 2 lakh while in private institutes and
